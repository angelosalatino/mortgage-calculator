# Mortgage Calculator


This repository contains a set of script that can help you navigate the complex world of mortgages.
Understand where your money go (i.e., equity vs. interests) and perhaps help you optimise your equity over the interests.


## Scripts available

- ```mortgage-calculator.ipynb``` calculates the amount of interests and equity earned through the variosu installments. This is useful is you don't perform early repayments


## Scripts to develop

- script for calculating the mortgage through one-off early repayment
- script for calculating the mortgage through monthly repayments (more than you are supposed to pay monthly)
- script to track re-mortgaging (i.e., different interest rates are applied through the process)

# Mortgage Calculator


This repository helps you understand your mortgage and potentially save money.  It breaks down your payments to show how much goes towards your loan balance (equity) versus interest, so you can explore ways to pay off your mortgage faster and reduce interest costs.


## Scripts available

- ```mortgage-calculator.ipynb``` calculates how much of your mortgage payments go towards interest and how much goes towards building equity (ownership) in your home. It's designed for mortgages with fixed payments, not those with early repayment options.


## Scripts to develop

- script for calculating the mortgage through one-off early repayment
- script for calculating the mortgage through monthly repayments (more than you are supposed to pay monthly)
- script to track re-mortgaging (i.e., different interest rates are applied through the process)

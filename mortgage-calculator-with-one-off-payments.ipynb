    "Especially in the UK, you can make overpayments totalling up to 10\\% of your original loan amount (not the current loan) during a 12 month period without incurring any applicable early repayment charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's assume you have received a bonus payment from your employer (e.g., £1,000), and you decide to make a one-off overpayment to increase you equity against your mortgage. This code helps you understanding how the interest (cost of borrowing) changes when we perform such one-off payments."

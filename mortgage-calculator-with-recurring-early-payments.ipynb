    "Boosting your monthly payments, even by rounding up, accelerates your mortgage repayment and reduces overall interest costs. For instance, by rounding it up, from £865 to £1,000. The excess goes into your equity, lowers the current principal, and therefore the cost for borrowing (due to interest).\n",
